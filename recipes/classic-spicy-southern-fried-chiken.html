    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Roscoe's classic spicy Southern fried chicken is the real dealâ€”deeply golden and</p>
    <p>crisp on the outside, and moist and tender inside. Marinated in buttermilk and</p>
    <p>hot sauce, it's spicy and flavorful.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>7 dashes hot sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Combine chicken, buttermilk, eggs, hot sauce, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1</p>
            <p>tablespoon black pepper in a large bowl. Stir until coated. Cover and refrigerate</p>
            <p>for at least 20 minutes or up to overnight,</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Combine flour, remaining 1 teaspoons salt, remaining 1 tablespoon black</p>
            <p>pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, oregano, and cayenne in a large</p>
            <p>bowl; whisk until well combined. Set a wire rack over a rimmed baking sheet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Remove chicken from the refrigerator. Working with one piece at a time, remove</p>
            <p>from the marinade and allow excess to drip off into flour dredge. Drop chicken</p>
            <p>into flour dredge. Coat evenly in the flour mixture, pressing dredge onto</p>
            <p>chicken. Set pieces on the prepared wire rack. When all pieces are coated,</p>
            <p>dredge and press each piece a second time; return chicken to the wire rack.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pour oil into a large Dutch oven to a depth of 1 inch. Heat over medium-high</p>
            <p>heat until it reaches 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a clean wire rack over a</p>
            <p>paper towel-lined baking sheet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Add a few chicken pieces to the hot oil and cook, turning once or twice, until</p>
            <p>golden brown on the outside, no longer pink at the bone, and the juices run</p>
            <p>clear, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant read thermometer inserted near the bone</p>
            <p>should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Maintain the oil temperature around</p>
            <p>320 degrees F (160 degrees C) during cooking. Remove chicken to the prepared</p>
            <p>clean wire rack. Return oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and repeat to fry</p>
            <p>remaining chicken. Serve immediately.</p>
        </li>
